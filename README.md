# 0G Chain
Zero Gravity (0G) is the foundational infrastructure for high-performance dapps and chains particularly for AI. 

It efficiently orchestrates utilization of hardware resources such as storage and compute and software assets such as data and models to handle the scale and complexity of AI workloads.

Continue reading [here](https://0g-doc-new.vercel.app/intro) if you want to learn more about 0G dAIOS and how its various layers enable limitless scalability.

## 0G Product Suite
- DA: ultra high-performance data availability layer with KZG and quorum-based DAS
- Storage: decentralized storage with erasure coding and replication
- Inference Serving: flexible serving framework for inferences and finetuning
- Network: high-performance, low-latency, and decentralized network

## Documentation
- If you want to build with 0G's network, DA layer, inference serving, or storage SDK, please refer to the [Build with 0G Documentation](https://0g-doc-new.vercel.app/).

- If you want to run a validator node, DA node, or storage node, please refer to the [Run a Node Documentation](https://0g-doc-new.vercel.app/run-a-node/overview).
